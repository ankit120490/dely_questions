This folder will contain code for Recipes Question.

The code is written in PHP and is fully functional. It can be extended to incorporate any JSON data for a recipe either from database or from JSON files. We just need to update the place where we are reading the JSON data.

Any new type for measurement like "cup" can be easily extended in the system. We only have to add the type in constant file.

We have converted all the array keys to lowercase to avoid case mismatch.

The function output is standard and can be used as API. In that case, we only need to define the error codes and there response message and then return the output.

The task was to write the code in Ruby. But I wasn't well the entire last week and early this week. I would really like you to atleast check my reasoning behind the code logic and to give me the opportunity to learn Ruby and contribute to the organization. Even if I am unable to proceed during this interview process, I would thank the entire team of Dely for giving me this opportunity to participate in the process. 
With 7 years of coding experience, I want to give the assurance that learning new things is very exciting opportunity for me and switching technology would be easier at this stage of my career.

Thank you once again and hoping for the best.
